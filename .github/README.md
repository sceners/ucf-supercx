██      - This program is based on the idea that every com file,
██        after self decrypting itself, will return to execute
██        itself as if it wasn't encrypted at all (IP = 100h)
██
██      - this program can't extract com files with anti-debugging
██        instructions.
██
██      - When all the registers equal zero, there is high
██        possibility that the program is decrypted (the 'Clean' option)
██
██      - This program isn't optimized at all, you can surely
██        reduce it's size by 10-100 bytes.
